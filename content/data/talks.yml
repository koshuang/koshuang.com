    Chances are your app is lying to your users. I know you don't mean it.
    Building truthful apps is hard. But you've been lied to by so many other
    apps you use and it is extremely frustrating. This frustration not only
    makes everyone's day worse, but it also makes users get out of that app as
    quickly as possible which for most apps is bad for the bottom line.


    So what's the lie? Well you'll have to come to the talk to find out! Don't
    worry though, I'll not only explain to you what the lie is, but I'll also
    show you how to correct it and delight your users in a way that moves the
    needle.
